# quasi maintainer guide

quasi is a Claude Code plugin for academic reading workflows: discovery, download, extraction, analysis, synthesis, translation, and schema checking.

## Important plugin-system facts

- Installed plugins load components from root-level `skills/`, `agents/`, `bin/`, `hooks/`, `monitors/`, `.mcp.json`, and `.lsp.json`.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is metadata only. Do not place components inside `.claude-plugin/`.
- This `CLAUDE.md` helps humans and Claude Code sessions opened inside the quasi source tree, but Claude Code does not load a plugin-root `CLAUDE.md` as context when quasi is installed as a plugin.

## Release checklist

1. Update `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
2. Mirror the same version in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   claude plugin validate plugins/quasi
   ```
4. If publishing a release tag, prefer:
   ```bash
   claude plugin tag plugins/quasi
   ```

The version in `plugin.json` takes precedence over marketplace entry versions. If these drift, installation still works but validation warns and users can see confusing version information.

## Runtime state

- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is for reading bundled code and assets only.
- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` is for persistent virtualenvs, caches, generated files, and installed dependencies.
- Avoid writing dependency state into the plugin root; installed plugin roots are versioned and may change across updates.
